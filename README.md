## Demo

One-click Railway deployment with live trading: authentication via Turnkey embedded wallet, real-time candle data after a few hours of market activity, and executing both market and limit orders.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Exchange Overview

![Architecture](./.github/assets/architecture.png)

This exchange is built as a modern, full-featured trading system with the following components:

- **Backend**
  - **API**: REST and WebSocket APIs with multi-language SDK support
  - **Database**: Dual architecture with PostgreSQL (OLTP) and ClickHouse (OLAP)
  - **Matching Engine**: In-memory orderbook with price-time priority matching
- **ui**: Next.js application with TradingView integration and embedded wallet
- **Bots**: Automated market makers with external market integration
- **Testing & Deployment**: Containerized development and one-click deployment

---

### Backend

![Backend Architecture](./.github/assets/backend.png)

#### Matching Engine

The matching engine is the core of the exchange, handling order placement, matching, and execution.

- **Orderbook**: In-memory B-tree implementation with price-time priority, O(log n) complexity
- **Matcher**: Price-time priority algorithm with continuous matching and partial fills
- **Executor**: Atomic trade execution with balance locking and transaction rollback

#### Database

The exchange uses a dual-database architecture optimized for different workloads:

- **ClickHouse (OLAP)**: Materialized views for real-time candlestick aggregation and time-series analytics
- **PostgreSQL (OLTP)**: Primary transactional database storing users, tokens, markets, orders, balances, and trades

#### API

- **REST & WebSocket**: OpenAPI-documented REST endpoints and real-time WebSocket subscriptions powered by Tokio
- **Multi-language SDKs**: TypeScript, Python, and Rust clients auto-generated from OpenAPI and JSON Schema

---

### ui

![ui Architecture](./.github/assets/ui.png)

Modern Next.js trading interface with professional features:

- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management with real-time WebSocket synchronization
- **TypeScript SDK**: Type-safe API client with WebSocket subscriptions
- **TradingView**: Advanced charting with custom drawing tools and real-time updates
- **Turnkey**: Embedded wallet with secure key management, no browser extension required
  - Note: When deploying, ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROXY_CONFIG_ID` are set as build-time environment variables

---

### Bots

![Bots Architecture](./.github/assets/bots.png)

Automated market-making bots to provide liquidity:

- **BTC/USDC**: Hyperliquid mirror bot that replicates order book depth with configurable risk parameters
- **BP/USDC**: LMSR (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule) market maker with dynamic spread adjustment (planned)

---

### Testing & Deployment

- **Devcontainers**: Easily start dev enviornment with tools pre-installed
- **Testcontainers**: Integration testing with isolated database instances and automated cleanup
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment
